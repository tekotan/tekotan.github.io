I graduated from Berkeley.

---

Even as I type that, it still feels surreal. Four years ago, I wasn’t even sure I wanted to go here. The reputation for intense coursework, competitive students, and the overwhelming pace of life made me hesitate. I imagined myself at a different school, one with less pressure and more predictability. But as it turns out, life has a funny way of putting you exactly where you’re supposed to be—even if it doesn’t feel that way at first.

When I walked into my first Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) event as a freshman, I had no idea how much that room would change the course of my time at Berkeley. I met upperclassmen who were doing things I hadn’t even thought possible—running startups, conducting research, and building things that actually mattered. Their mentorship pushed me to take risks: to try quantitative finance, to apply for research positions, and to pursue paths I never would have considered on my own. The academic rigor I once feared became something I embraced. Every brutal problem set and late-night debugging session made me more focused, more adaptable, and more confident in my abilities.

Sophomore year, I started expanding my learning beyond EECS. I joined Venture Strategy Solutions and took on a project with Smobler, a Web3 company. That experience took me to Austin for a crypto event, where I went from barely understanding blockchain to speaking with founders building the next wave of decentralized tools. It was my first taste of thinking not just as an engineer, but as a strategist.

I also pushed myself academically. I enrolled in graduate-level EECS courses and found myself sitting in intimate seminars led by world-class researchers: Angjoo Kanazawa, Alyosha Efros, Aditi Krishnapriyan, and Jitendra Malik. They didn’t just teach—they modeled what it looked like to be curious, playful, and rigorous in their research. That inspiration led me to join BAIR and UCSF’s Cardiac Vision Lab. I explored generative modeling, contributed to video understanding research, and published a first-author paper in APL Machine Learning. I learned to write, to collaborate, to lead, and most importantly, to care deeply about the questions I was asking.

But Berkeley wasn’t just about academics. It shaped who I became as a person. Through HKN, I went from being mentored to mentoring others—whether that was tutoring, organizing senior tech support events, or leading our chapter as President. I found myself drawn to community-building, making sure that everyone—from prospective freshmen to seasoned faculty—felt like they had a place here.

I also learned how to celebrate the journey. I joined in Cal Day panels, cheered until I lost my voice at College Game Day, and rushed the field after a Big Game victory over Stanford I’ll never forget. Berkeley taught me that success isn’t just what you accomplish—it’s also how you show up for others and enjoy the ride along the way.

Now that I’ve graduated, I’m taking a gap year to travel, reflect, and continue research with BAIR while preparing my PhD applications. But the mindset I gained here—the curiosity, the resilience, the hunger to explore uncharted territory—will stay with me wherever I go.

In the end, the school I wasn’t sure I wanted to attend became the place I’m most grateful for. Berkeley gave me challenges I didn’t think I could meet and a community I never expected to find. It changed my life. And for that, I’ll always be thankful.
