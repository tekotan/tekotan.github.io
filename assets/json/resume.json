    "summary": "Freshly minted EECS (Berkeley ’25) grad spending a gap-year backpacking through research labs, hack-spaces and pickup-basketball courts while polishing PhD applications. My work lives at the intersection of self-supervised video learning, diffusion generative models and large-scale system design: from zero-shot point-tracking Gaussians at BAIR to LLM-powered catalog pipelines at Amazon, to 3-D cardiac wave synthesis at UCSF. I thrive on projects that blend algorithmic novelty with real-world impact, and I love mentoring small teams, writing clean PyTorch/JAX, and turning wild ideas into reproducible benchmarks.",
